# Quest 9: The Greedy Goblin

# Total gold pieces and number of friends
total_gold = 27
friends = 4

# Calculate how much each friend gets (integer division)
gold_per_friend = total_gold // friends

# Calculate how much the goblin keeps (remainder using modulus)
goblin_keeps = total_gold % friends

# Display the results
print(f"Each friend receives {gold_per_friend} gold pieces.")
