This project is designed to help build a strong foundation in Python programming through 30 hands-on coding quests divided into 6 progressive levels.

Each quest focuses on an important programming concept such as:

Variables

Data Types

User Input

Conditional Statements

Loops

Functions

Logical Reasoning

The goal is to move from beginner concepts to more advanced problem-solving challenges step by step.
